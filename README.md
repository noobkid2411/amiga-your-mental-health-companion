 Mental health is one of the most important issues in the current scenario. One needs to be on their feet in order to keep themselves from drowning into different facets of depression and mental health issues,while maintaing a healthy profile overall.
 The application is visualised and emuated as a prototype on Figma currently,while some of its functionalities are templated and explored on html and css to be integrated to the application backend in the future.
 The functionalities of the app would be:
 
 1> To create a holistic profile of the user

 2> To help in hassle free login using Magic API for an existing user

 3> To  create a basic questionnare focused on the prominent mental issues of the current crowd,which can lead to a basic idea of the mental state of the person.Our databases currently have a framework for five major mental health hazards that people suffer from them,and 10 certified yes-no questions that will help guage one's level of mental health in different ways.We hope to expand this database into more in depth questions to generate better more comprehensive reports.

 4> To generate reports for better assesing the state and prompting the user to seek help if necessary.

 During times of distress,physical health takes a front seat while mental health is shifted to the back,we feel this application will remind the users to keep a check on the demons of mind,which are not readily visible but are harmful in a lot of ways!
