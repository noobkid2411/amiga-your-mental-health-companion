The profile creation tab on the final application is currently visualised on a form structure powered by airtable database management.

The link of the form is here: https://airtable.com/shr1tX2XiNAdTK7EC 

The source code of the same is in the html file in this directory.

The data gets stored in a csv file supported by airtables again,the template of which is given in this directory.

Once integrated in application,we would like to modulate this feauture to the UI of the app as shown below:
