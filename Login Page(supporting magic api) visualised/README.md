The login tab on the final application is currently visualised on a form structure powered by airtable database management on web view.

The link of the form is here: https://airtable.com/shr3aiDGr1qyj1Bi8
This form currently is devoid of magic api.
Another html file with a simple login interface using magic api is added in the repository that traces back to an app,when integrated with the complete application,would render into the UI of the finished app.
The source code of both the login forms are in the html file in this directory.

For the airtable link,The data gets stored in a csv file supported by airtables again,the template of which is given in this directory.

Once integrated in the finished application,we would like to visualise this form in the UI of the app as shown below:
